# RAG-Mastery a personal path from basic to master in RAG
Welcome to **RAG-Mastery**, my personal guide to mastering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This repository is my space to document my journey from foundational concepts through to the most advanced techniques, helping me understand and apply these methods effectively.

## Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful framework that integrates retrieval into the sequience generation process. This framework combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative lenaguage models to enchance text generation capabilities. This approach operates by dynaically fetching relevant documents or data snippetss based on a given query and using this retrieved information to generate a coherent and contextually appropiate response.

A simple diagram that show te key components and procces of RAG is this one.
